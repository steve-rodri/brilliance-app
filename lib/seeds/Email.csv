   THE NIGHT LIGHT

   

        A 90-year-old man goes for a physical. All of his tests come back with normal results.
       

        The doctor says, ""Larry, everything looks great. How are you doing mentally and emotionally? Are you at peace with God?""
       

   

        Larry replies, ""God and I are tight. He knows I have poor eyesight, so He's fixed it so when I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, poof! The light goes on. When I'm done, poof! The light goes off.""
       

        ""Wow, that's incredible,"" the    doctor says.
       

   

        A little later in the day, the doctor calls Larry's wife. ""Bonnie,"" he says, ""Larry is doing fine! But I had to call you because I'm in awe of his relationship with God. Is it true that he gets up during the night, and poof, the light goes on in the bathroom, and               
       

        when he's done, poof, the light goes off?"" 
       

   

         ""Oh sweet Jesus"", exclaims Bonnie. ""He's peeing in the refrigerator again!""

We're back.  LOL

Attached is the plan

There are 15 room drops   all listed with a nice plug symbol (all 20 amps)

I need 7 towers. I am shipping you the lights, clamps and Edison plugs to your location (please attach the Edison plugs)

Dan has advised on what I need to light this one. 

Each tower will need to be 15 tall  4 of the fixtures will be lightly focused for general lighting (I have a lift for this one)

Will need a power drop (20 amps) to each with the extension cords and the power strip.

They are painting the floor (since it is in terrible shape) so we can not drive into the facility this time on the in.

I am starting setup at 8am figure you there around 9.

Break is in the 25th at 9pm.

Mark

How are things? If you have time for a call…my board president went to an event recently at the parish

Hope you are well. We have a client looking for a setup similar to this. Could you give me an all-inclusive quote for something like this(minus any sound equipment)? 

So that would be the LED Stages, 2 screens w/ stands, façade, 2 uprights with sleeves?

 

It would be for a mitzvah in May next year in Westchester. 12:30pm-5:30pm. Please send over asap as the client is calling around and we’d love to book it through you guys!!!

Great speaking with you today.  As we discussed there is a lot of interest
in the Hammerstein ballroom venue, especially since it has the hotel above
the ballroom.

Here is a basic list of what the Imperial Court is looking for:

Large stage
very important - an area to be used as a dressing room near stage
runway brought in by client  -  goes out around 30 ft x 8 ft wide - has a T
at the end 15 ft x 8 ft
need a good size aria for Chinese auction
catering - dinner and alcohol
seating for 600- 800 people

hotel accommodations for out of town guests

Client wants venue research to be wrapped up by end of March.

NEXT STEP:
Please forward event manager contact info for Hammerstein ball room. I will
send it out to Champ Knecht - the lead venue committee contact for Imperial
Court.

Thanks,
Lou Savarese

Digital Signatures

Gigbuilder has the ability to allow your prospects to digitally sign their contracts. Unlike other event management software on the market that will only allow your prospect to follow a link in an email, Gigbuilder goes a step beyond. Gigbuilder allows the same procedure with emails but also allows your prospect to sign their contract from within their online event planner. Your prospect can make an immediate payment as well if allowed. Plus, Gigbuilder can send you an SMS/text message when the contract is signed.

85,100,Krista Fileccia,Quick Question,"Hey Bobby,

As you may know we had a fire a few years back at one of our Community Centers. Renovations have been completed and we are almost ready to reopen the North Albany Community to residents.  However, we are in the process of finding a company that we can purchase a sound system from.  I don't know all of the details but I believe this company would also install the sound system.  Joe Visconti asked that I reach out to you regarding this for two reasons, does Brilliance do that kind of work or do you know any companies that do sound system installations?   As you know we at the town have to go through a bidding process, and Joe will have more details on the specifics.

Hope all is well!  So I am shooting Emma Denson 3/17/18 at the Palace, and she asked if I could get you a slideshow of some images from her studio shoot that you guys can play during the party on the screens.  I put together a slideshow and sending it to you (I will also bring a back up on a usb the day of.) You can download the slideshow directly from the link.  There are actually 2.. Same pictures, just did 2 types.
If you could just confirm that will be great!!!
Thank you so much!

Please be advised that effective immediately, pursuant to Executive Order 2-2018 (the ""Executive Order""), Nassau County (the ""County"") has implemented a zero-tolerance policy regarding gifts to or from anyone that does business with or is likely in the future to do business with the County, including, but not limited to, tenants, vendors, concessionaires, and their representatives or representative associations (""County Vendor"").  The policy is as follows:

In accordance with the Executive Order, a County Vendor shall not offer, give, or agree to give anything of value to any County employee, agent, consultant, construction manager, or other person or firm representing the County (a ""County Representative""), including members of a County Representativeâs immediate family, in connection with the performance by such County Representative of duties involving transactions with the County Vendor on behalf of the County.  Additionally, a County Vendor is prohibited from accepting any gifts, gratuities, or payments of any kind, form, or value from any County Representative, including members of a County Representativeâs immediate family, in connection with the performance by such County Representative of duties involving transactions with the County Vendor on behalf of the County. 

As used herein, ""anything of value"" or ""any kind, form, or value"" shall include, but not be limited to, meals, holiday gifts, holiday baskets, gift cards, tickets to golf outings, tickets to sporting events, currency of any kind, cash discounts not available to all County employees, or any other gifts, gratuities, favorable opportunities or preferences.  As used herein, ""members of a County Representativeâs immediate family"" shall include a spouse, child, parent, or sibling.  This policy also applies to subcontractors of County Vendors that have been engaged under any County contract.

Furthermore, a County Vendor that is required to complete any contract disclosure form(s) in response to a County solicitation or as part of a County contract submission (a ""Disclosure Form"") shall disclose in the conflicts of interest section of the Disclosure Form any and all instances where the County Vendor employs any spouse, child, or parent of a County employee of the agency or department that contracted or procured the goods or services.  The County Vendor has a continuing obligation, as circumstances arise, to update the Disclosure Form throughout the term of any County contract awarded to the County Vendor.

If you become aware of any violation of this policy, it must be reported immediately to the County Confidential Hotline at (516) 571-STOP.

105,15,Michael Lamego,City Theatrical New Leasing Offer,"Hi Bob
I hope all is well. I wanted to check in and let you know that we have recently added a leasing program to our Wireless event Lighting Line (QolorPoint and QolorStirp units). I attached some information on this below for you to check out. This has been allowing our customers to purchase any quantity of fixtures and not be liable for any payment for several months. Please feel free to look into this and contact me if you have any questions about pricing or would like to go through with a purchase. I look forward to hearing back from you soon!
Mike

Odalys:  I will be in touch in regard to the appt on March 28th.  Package 2 does not include video, only Package 3 and 4.  As far as format you can send me the video in a MP4  and the  photos in a jpeg.  Hope this helps.  Mary Ellen

Ok. Can we do March 28 at 3 p.m. at Carlyle? I can give the check on that day. Does package 2 allow us to play videos? What is the appropriate format to get you the videos and photos?

Yes it is better to have as much Video Content as possible for the date.  We can meet as close as one week before 4/7.   Before that I need to invoice as the payment has to be 10 days previous too the party date.Do you want to get together the third week in March?

Odalys: Being that the Demo was a few months back I thought it  best to set up the “Finals” appt.  We would meet once more and go over all the details.  Color Selections for Walls/Columns Etc.  We would also go over the Montage, Logo, Photos etc.  Do you have an idea of which package you are going with?  Let me know what works for you and if you are available during the day or night only.

odalys :  Going back to January 2018 we did a “Demo” at CATP.  As the date is quickly approaching
 I want to follow up as to whether you would like to set up a “Finals” appt the end of this month.

Hi Bobby,

 

Hope you are well. We have a client looking for a setup similar to this. Could you give me an all-inclusive quote for something like this(minus any sound equipment)? 

So that would be the LED Stages, 2 screens w/ stands, façade, 2 uprights with sleeves?

 

It would be for a mitzvah in May next year in Westchester. 12:30pm-5:30pm. Please send over asap as the client is calling around and we’d love to book it through you guys!!!

I will have guys working in another building at the Botanical Garden on that day so either the foreman or myself will join Bob at the meeting.

The location of this work is the NY Botanical Garden in the Bronx.  I sent Bob pictures of the auditorium.  We recently completed an audio and video installation in the auditorium and now the customer is looking for a proposal for a new lighting system.

Subject: Travel Advisory | Important Terminal 4 information | Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL)

[Your Upcoming Flight]


Dear Kathleen M Richards,

We want to share some information should your flight be scheduled for either arrival or departure through Terminal 4 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, FL (FLL):

  *   The only check-in option for all JetBlue flights departing FLL is located in Terminal 3.

  *   JetBlue gates in Terminal 4 are located at the end of the terminal.

  *   Terminals 3 and 4 are connected post TSA security checkpoint, and customers will still use the Terminal 3 TSA checkpoint if departing from Terminal 4.

  *   With current airport construction considered, the walk through Terminal 4 to our gates can take a bit more time.


  *   It is always recommended to double check the gate assignment for your flight upon arrival at the airport in case of a gate change between the time your boarding pass is printed and your arrival at FLL.

All this in mind, we encourage you to allow for extra travel time if needed to reach your gate in plenty of time for your departure.

As always, please check the status of your flight online<https://www.jetblue.com/flightstatus/#/> or via the JetBlue app<http://www.jetblue.com/mobile/> prior to arriving at the airport.

Thank you for choosing to fly with us. We look forward to welcoming you at FLL.

Sincerely,

JetBlue

Hi Russ:  OK  I went through what you sent me today through Dropbox. (Photos/Images).  I will loop these on 4 screens upon Entrance and throughout the night or if you want to pick 4  (Stable)for Entrance with the Logo on 

Screen 2 (behind the DJ Booth I could do that also .  I am concerned if we use all the pictures upon entrance it would be too fast.  As of today I have the above.  I know White Light is working on the Montage, have them send it to 

me (Dropbox) when available, as I like to test it before day of on our system.  When available send me the logo also.  I have made a notation ET is doing the Zap Shots.  I will be speaking to you or Jennifer over the next few

Hi tech sent over loop photos have you received

Also does your tech control volume on montage? If so there are videos embedded and volume may need to be adjusted slightly.

Hi,
Below are the pictures for the loop to be used during cocktail hour in both the kids room and the main bar room. As discussed with the tech i would like my logo to be on the screens for the cocktail hour during the first 20-30 minutes and then play this loop of pictures.

I am still coming by with the usb which will have the loop for the main party room.

Thank you,
Sharonie Kesselman

Ok thank you Mary Ellen.
I will have guys working in another building at the Botanical Garden on that day so either the foreman or myself will join Bob at the meeting.

The location of this work is the NY Botanical Garden in the Bronx.  I sent Bob pictures of the auditorium.  We recently completed an audio and video installation in the auditorium and now the customer is looking for a proposal for a new lighting system.

Bob,

As we discussed on the phone today, I have an opportunity at the NY Botanical Garden.  I attached some pictures of the room to this email.  I left a voicemail for the customer to give him a heads up that you will be reaching out to him.  Please get in touch with him, set up a site visit, and then send the price quote to me.  Once you have an appointment with him please let me know the day and time so I can possibly join you.  Let me know if you have any questions or if you need any further information from me.

Just confirming this Saturday. Can you email me the signed contract by today

And what the power requirements for this?

 

Also, we are working with a planner (and client) that's super particular
about everything. I received this from the planner, Jessica, and I want to
make sure to pass this on to you so you can relay to the techs on Saturday:

 

""Since I have not worked with all of you before, I do kindly request that
all vendors wear all black business attire including sleeves to the elbow
and closed shoes (no sandals). This includes all delivery people. Men may
wear suit jacket and tie if they wish. I thank you in advance. 

 

If you should need a beverage during the event, please ask me or anyone on
my team, or the event manager to get it for you. One of my biggest pet
peeves is seeing a vendor eating and drinking from the guest food station
and bars. I am here to assist you. It does not look good to the guests if
they see a vendor in line for anything, and they don't know if you are
getting water or alcohol so that is why I will be happy to grab you a
water.""

 

Who is the tech(s) on Saturday and what time are they arriving? Can you make
sure they have my cell 646-708-2439 and to only ask me if they have any
questions.

Robert,

Sorry we’ve been unable to connect up until this point. However definitely wanted to make sure you're taken care of.

Let me know if:

a. You’re busy, and I understand it may not be the best time for you to connect.
b. You’d like some more information to help determine what’s the best fit for you
c. You simply don’t ever want to come out to an Islanders/Nets game

304,4,Jason Lipset,Long Island Marathon 2018 (more),"This is what I believe I requested from you last year:





Sunday May 6 - Charles Lindbergh Blvd

- 10K Race Truss:  (35'?)
- Marathon Truss: (40'?)
- Crank-up ground support for both, setup in the AM before 6AM.



Saturday May 5 - Eisenhower Park (can be setup Friday / Friday evening)
- 2 Upright trusses on weight bases (10' tall?  Taller?).  These will be used to hold vertical banners that say ""Start""
(I may actually have the equipment -bases and light-weight truss- but I would need sand bags and labor


 I will need to rent 8 pop-up tents.  I am not sure if I need any generators or not, as the park supplies those and we may have enough - I will get back to you.


Labor - Sunday May 6
I am not sure, yet, but if you have a couple of guys available to work the day, as you did last year, I have some other video stuff that I may need help setting up.   This may include moving the trusses that are to be used for the 5K start over to the results tent or something and having monitors put on them (not sure if I need to rent monitors from you or not - I haven't confirmed the availability of all the technology yet.


I am not sure if I need anything else as of this time, but I will let you know asap.  I am finalizing a lot of things tomorrow.


Thank you,
Jason

Hey Bobby, how are you?

A few things..


Any chance I am ever going to see anything from the LED video screen job from Feb 2017??


Second, the Long Island Marathon is May 4 - May 6 with the Marathon / Half / 10K on May 6.  We will again need trussing for the starting line.  I will also need at least one truss at the finish line and if possible, would like to have your guys setup some other equipment for me on Saturday and Sunday.


Please let me know what your availability is for that weekend.




Thanks!

Hi Mary Ellen
Can you tell me what time the tech arrives?
Our photos start at 5:30 and I of course would like the ambiance of the lights!!
Also, the screen behind the dj seems somewhat small for the montage- is that the only screen it can be viewed on?? It is set back and the dj and brilliance will be in front of it- or are they using the one that is set to the left side??
Thanks!!

Ok thank you Mary Ellen.
I will have guys working in another building at the Botanical Garden on that day so either the foreman or myself will join Bob at the meeting.

The location of this work is the NY Botanical Garden in the Bronx.  I sent Bob pictures of the auditorium.  We recently completed an audio and video installation in the auditorium and now the customer is looking for a proposal for a new lighting system.

Bob,

As we discussed on the phone today, I have an opportunity at the NY Botanical Garden.  I attached some pictures of the room to this email.  I left a voicemail for the customer to give him a heads up that you will be reaching out to him.  Please get in touch with him, set up a site visit, and then send the price quote to me.  Once you have an appointment with him please let me know the day and time so I can possibly join you.  Let me know if you have any questions or if you need any further information from me.

335,48,John Schappert,RE: Bronx Botanical gardens,"Bob,

Can you write a Scope Of Work for the lighting proposal?  Just a paragraph that spells out in layman's terms what we are proposing.  This will help me manage customer expectations for the project.  It should spell out what is included in the project, and what we are expecting (if anything) from the customer, such as electrical, scaffolding, building access hours, etc.   Would it be possible to get this to me by tomorrow afternoon at the latest?


I am going there on Friday morning and will count the chair mounted Isle lights and take pictures of them.  I guess we will make a second proposal for that after I bring back that information.

You've got a new message from
Stewart Manor Country Club
Hello Jaclyn, congratulations to you and Jordan, and thank you for
considering the Stewart Manor Country Club for your wedding! I have checked
our calendar and found that July 13, 2019 has been booked, but I do have
July 6th and 20th available as well as some other dates in that month.
Pricing for our weddings ranges from $100-130 per person plus tax with no
additional charges. Our menu does not typically include a wedding cake, but
that doesn't mean that we can not discuss it. I have attached a sample menu
for you to review, but please keep in mind that due to the fact that we
host only one wedding at a time that we can customize this menu to meet
your wants and needs as well as work with your budget. Have you started
visiting venues yet?

- James

Jack's bar mitzvah on April 20 was wonderful...but it dawned on me the morning after that the Loop Photos were never shown on the screens as we had discussed.  I even asked a number of guests and they said all they saw were the same 4 photos.  There is certainly nothing we can do about it now but I did want to make you aware of this!
ThanksMarni

Mary Ellen,

As we discussed previously, you should have received an e-mail on April 18. 2018 for our Procurement division inviting you to register as a vendor in our payment System called SmartSource.

Please let me know when you completed the invitation, it will then take a few days after completion for them to issue payment.

Thanks

Hi Don:  When you get a moment I need your help with the following:  As of today we have not received payment for your event 4/14 at Carlyle At The Palace.  The invoice total is $900.00.  In an earlier e-mail I see a Procurement Service form, in looking at this I ask if this is for businesses or Personal contacts.  If anything is needed including  W9, please let me know and I will forward them immediately.  I thank you in advance for your help.

I can’t honestly relate to the specific job or check since the folder has been deleted since. But again I believe I worked that party and if the loop or a bunch of photos were within the folder I know I played it. Lots of times people are drunk at these parties and cannot remember haha. If there happen to be zaps I bet looking through them would show different images on screens. No big deal thou at this point.

Bob,

Can you write a Scope Of Work for the lighting proposal?  Just a paragraph that spells out in layman’s terms what we are proposing.  This will help me manage customer expectations for the project.  It should spell out what is included in the project, and what we are expecting (if anything) from the customer, such as electrical, scaffolding, building access hours, etc.   Would it be possible to get this to me by tomorrow afternoon at the latest?


I am going there on Friday morning and will count the chair mounted Isle lights and take pictures of them.  I guess we will make a second proposal for that after I bring back that information.

361,79,Jim Schoenfelder,RE: Brilliance,"Bob,

I may not have enough of the Power Pars available.  We have two different versions of them and if we can supply all that you need, it will need to be a mixture of the two.  I'm checking on an existing reservation to see if this can be possible.  I have another option.  I've attached a cut sheet for the Elation Fuze 575.  This is a cool white moving head that we are planning to use as replacements for the Powerpars which we seem to be phasing out.  Please take a look and let me know if you think this might be an option for you.  I have plenty of the Fuze 575's available.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jim

Thank you for sending this over. I forwarded your email over to Deslyn
earlier and she has it now.  I also let her know that you needed
approximately 4 hours to set-up and they are going to get back to me about
Friday night.  It looks like they are going to allow it, but we need to
wait on the building manager for final approval.

I will stay on top of it and let you know as soon as I hear anything. Reach
out anytime if you need anything from me or Steve.

Thank you,
Sean

367,79,Jim Schoenfelder,RE: Brilliance,"Bobby,

Attached is your quote.  This quote does not include the Scissor Lift, Fork Lift or labor.  The quote included is for the split of two types of Power Pars, but I still don't have confirmation that we have these available.  I also noted on the quote the price to change the Power Pars to Elation Fuze 575's.  The noted price is the full price for the Fuze fixtures.  If you don't think you can swing that, I'm willing to split the difference with you which would be about $3,500.00 added to the existing quoted total (or deducted from the Fuze total).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Please let me know if you would like to confirm this order.

Thanks,

Jim

370,81,Stephanie Busia,"RE: May 17th, 2018 EVENT PROGRAM DETAILS","Hi Bob,

We are excited to be working with your team again this year for our Builder's Breakfast this Thursday.  I wanted to start sending over the media pieces for our program.  I have attached a draft of the script that highlights the order of the audio visual tools.  We are making a few changes to the script, but not in terms of the order of the program.  Also below is a dropbox link with the video files that are needed.  We are not using the ReStore video that is included in the link.  I am putting some finishing touches on the scrolling powerpoint that will be playing while everyone is walking in and then again when everyone is walking out.

Here is a quick breakdown of the program:

7:30AM- guests start arriving/registering

*         Scrolling picture Powerpoint

*         Light music playing in the background

The quote for the forklift and two scissor lifts (with ""diaper"" drip tarps for each scissor) is attached.  Two weeks' rental is the same price as the month, so there's no additional charge to keep it through the end of the day on Monday 7/16.

Hi Bob,

We are excited to be working with your team again this year for our Builder’s Breakfast this Thursday.  I wanted to start sending over the media pieces for our program.  I have attached a draft of the script that highlights the order of the audio visual tools.  We are making a few changes to the script, but not in terms of the order of the program.  Also below is a dropbox link with the video files that are needed.  We are not using the ReStore video that is included in the link.  I am putting some finishing touches on the scrolling powerpoint that will be playing while everyone is walking in and then again when everyone is walking out.

Here is a quick breakdown of the program:

7:30AM- guests start arriving/registering
•         Scrolling picture Powerpoint
•         Light music playing in the background
8:05AM- Program begins
•         Switch to a static slide of our 30th Anniversary logo (how would you like me to send this to you?  Just logo or a static slide in powerpoint?)
•         First video: 30th Anniversary Video, then back to static slide

•         Third Video: 16 Years later, then back to static slide

Hi Bob,

We are excited to be working with your team again this year for our Builder’s Breakfast this Thursday.  I wanted to start sending over the media pieces for our program.  I have attached a draft of the script that highlights the order of the audio visual tools.  We are making a few changes to the script, but not in terms of the order of the program.  Also below is a dropbox link with the video files that are needed.  We are not using the ReStore video that is included in the link.  I am putting some finishing touches on the scrolling powerpoint that will be playing while everyone is walking in and then again when everyone is walking out.

Here is a quick breakdown of the program:

7:30AM- guests start arriving/registering
•         Scrolling picture Powerpoint
•         Light music playing in the background
8:05AM- Program begins
•         Switch to a static slide of our 30th Anniversary logo (how would you like me to send this to you?  Just logo or a static slide in powerpoint?)
•         First video: 30th Anniversary Video, then back to static slide
•         Second video: CEO Build, then back to static slide
•         Third Video: 16 Years later, then back to static slide
•         ReStore Logo
•         Static Slide
9:00AM- Program ends, as people are leaving put the Scrolling picture powerpoint back up.

Video Links (we will not be using the ReStore one, so only 3 or the 4):
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/enck3bg8m7qgxq5/AAABEvEoXkRiZM_siTNcCh44a?dl=0

Les mentioned that there is an event at Stonebridge that afternoon before, so your guys will be coming in to set up late Wednesday night.  I would like to do a run through with them the morning of the program.  What time will the guys be able to be there Thursday morning?

Hi Bob,

We are excited to be working with your team again this year for our Builder’s Breakfast this Thursday.  I wanted to start sending over the media pieces for our program.  I have attached a draft of the script that highlights the order of the audio visual tools.  We are making a few changes to the script, but not in terms of the order of the program.  Also below is a dropbox link with the video files that are needed.  We are not using the ReStore video that is included in the link.  I am putting some finishing touches on the scrolling powerpoint that will be playing while everyone is walking in and then again when everyone is walking out.

Here is a quick breakdown of the program:

7:30AM- guests start arriving/registering
•         Scrolling picture Powerpoint
•         Light music playing in the background
8:05AM- Program begins
•         Switch to a static slide of our 30th Anniversary logo (how would you like me to send this to you?  Just logo or a static slide in powerpoint?)
•         First video: 30th Anniversary Video, then back to static slide
•         Second video: CEO Build, then back to static slide
•         Third Video: 16 Years later, then back to static slide
•         ReStore Logo
•         Static Slide
9:00AM- Program ends, as people are leaving put the Scrolling picture powerpoint back up.

Video Links (we will not be using the ReStore one, so only 3 or the 4):
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/enck3bg8m7qgxq5/AAABEvEoXkRiZM_siTNcCh44a?dl=0

Les mentioned that there is an event at Stonebridge that afternoon before, so your guys will be coming in to set up late Wednesday night.  I would like to do a run through with them the morning of the program.  What time will the guys be able to be there Thursday morning?

How is everything doing.
This is the link for the montage that you are looking for.
You have to Download it from a computer not a mobile device.
I will also bring it with me on a flash drive. Just to play it safe.

418,106,,[FWD: FW: SHRM-LI 5-23-18 Breakfast Meeting Presentation],"Good Morning, Bobby,

Our next SHRM-Li chapter meeting is this Wednesday, May 23rd @ 8:00 a.m. till 10:00 a.m.

I've requested that the venue, Carlyle at the Palace in Plainview, be open at 7:00 a.m. for all to set up.

We will need the usual five screens, a lavaliere mic and a hand held mic.  In addition our guest speaker has asked for ""an HDMI cord or something to hook up her laptop to the AVs projector system"".   If this is not something you typically supply, please let me know and I will ask the speaker to bring her own.

Please confirm you can provide the above and send me an invoice so we can have a check for you Wednesday morning.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to call me on my cell #631.374.6440.

As always, thank you for your professional service.

Warm regards,

Joan

Bob,

Can you write a Scope Of Work for the lighting proposal?  Just a paragraph that spells out in layman’s terms what we are proposing.  This will help me manage customer expectations for the project.  It should spell out what is included in the project, and what we are expecting (if anything) from the customer, such as electrical, scaffolding, building access hours, etc.   Would it be possible to get this to me by tomorrow afternoon at the latest?


I am going there on Friday morning and will count the chair mounted Isle lights and take pictures of them.  I guess we will make a second proposal for that after I bring back that information.

467,1762,Tasia Johnson,Re: Johnson/Browne Wedding 8/24/18,"Good Morning,

I wanted to thank you for setting up the lighting demonstration yesterday. Besides the fact that everything was amazing, I want to give a small review for the technician Steven that came to meet us. He was very helpful in explain the packages, carefully showed us various options with thought involved and accommodated me who had to FaceTime in through my fiancé because my train was extremely late and I could not make it on time. So much so that I missed the initial presentation but he kindly stayed and then presented again. To me, that showed empathy, amazing work ethic and dedication that he did not need to provide but did so. He is a wonderful individual and please pass this note on to him if you can. We (especially I) am so thankful! Besides the excellent presentation, he helped to make our decision an easy one. 

We are very interested in investing in a package with Brilliance. Please let me know what the next steps are to get the process started!

Thank you so much for taking the time out to read this email and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Respectfully yours,
Tasia Johnson

The screens are going to be used by our DJ by the name of Evan Brandwein of PH Event Group Ltd. He told us that your company owns the screens in the Carlyle and that if we were to get the basic screens package, then it would allow him to use the screens with his DJ equipment for putting effects with his music for a more lively party atmosphere.

Besides the fact that everything was amazing, I want to give a small review for the technician Steven that came to meet us. He was very helpful in explain the packages, carefully showed us various options with thought involved and accommodated me who had to FaceTime in through my fiancé because my train was extremely late and I could not make it on time. So much so that I missed the initial presentation but he kindly stayed and then presented again. To me, that showed empathy, amazing work ethic and dedication that he did not need to provide but did so. He is a wonderful individual and please pass this note on to him if you can. We (especially I) am so thankful! Besides the excellent presentation, he helped to make our decision an easy one.

532,1766,Hay Green,Greenberg Party June 16 - Carlyle,"Hi Bob.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me last week. I am sure you are
aware of the discussions that went on yesterday between Steve, Maryellen
and me. To say that this was difficult and unprofessional is an
understatement. I really did give this a lot of thought before I contacted
you today. I called 2x but there was no answer and the last time I called I
left messages (2x) and no one returned my calls.

I would like to speak with you when you have a moment. I would like this to
go smoothly and in the end be able to share on social media what a
wonderful experience I had using Brilliance at Carlyle.

Please contact me at 516-317-2843.

Best,
Hayley

Music Under the Stars is almost here...yikes!  I'm sending all of the stage plots I have (some of them you  have already received).  Most of the bands are tributes or even repeats from last year, and everyone was more than pleased with the lighting last year!  Whenever you have some free time  let me know and we can talk lighting for the shows.

Thanks,

608,1799,Dave Silkin,FW: Luxul Class: Next Level Networking for the Custom Integrator,"Good Afternoon,

I want to make sure you are aware of the LUXUL Next Level Networking for the Custom Integrator class is this Wednesday here in Plainview. This class is an extensive networking course with topics including: industry specific best practices for wired and wireless to overcome common network challenges, the importance of site surveys, the advantages of PDUs and remote monitoring, providing a higher level of security and parental control, making Wifi work for you, an explanation of mesh vs. active roaming and much more. This training is designed to help our dealers/integrators expand their IP networking knowledge, master the company's products and learn all about the exciting and profitable LUXUL/Domotz relationship.

Integrators utilizing Luxul routers with Domotz technology will receive alerts when network issues arise - allowing them to take immediate action - and can share device information with Luxul's support team for swift and easy troubleshooting. The routers also eliminate the need to purchase a separate Luxul Domotz Pro for remote management. This lowers network costs and speeds setup, improving the bottom line for integrators while providing a better experience for their clients.

LUXUL + Domotz = Recurring Revenue want to know more,
sign up here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/luxul-training-featuring-domotz-tickets-46952221358<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0014Yn-e4HXimtJ3SexJwtIl2fwSG83c8mIHxYSotyirzc_mVUN3aSgWYHdTlGz1gACY5PRwpWZvVNG3SlYi18OcVgWs7DBEbJ-PRYW_IfRPAjXw-OBjcGjfYVCaSihabGd80limcE9QxCFgrcymaSHUJDz2mVmnL_WAgZsO-p82VwzZ0QjNqWQ2aH3xRi-A7uZaTlEo7mnj8XgLl0MZlPoFd-uSAOWmUbxB5n9JuZ4qOSZAF1CLY8ApTPFRff_Pao3&c=h7faqIbrTz40c3yqeBH0SP8jfrceJdiuZjYp8MDBM0xtgqNbNE7M_w==&ch=XOlPfehnihqeMuSgykXN9LdIzrhWNbw_vyzNfLH9FJA8fGYf_RSkow==>

If you or someone in your company is in charge of your clients networks, you should attend this class on Wednesday. There are two sessions, 9am-12pm and 1pm-4pm. Lunch will be served at Noon.

I hope to see you here.

Want to make sure we are both working on the same date.

Besides the fact that everything was amazing, I want to give a small review for the technician Steven that came to meet us. He was very helpful in explain the packages, carefully showed us various options with thought involved and accommodated me who had to FaceTime in through my fiancé because my train was extremely late and I could not make it on time. So much so that I missed the initial presentation but he kindly stayed and then presented again. To me, that showed empathy, amazing work ethic and dedication that he did not need to provide but did so. He is a wonderful individual and please pass this note on to him if you can. We (especially I) am so thankful! Besides the excellent presentation, he helped to make our decision an easy one.

Just keep forwarding me the invoices. I already have the first four (4) shows.
If you can forward me the Invoice for Tuesday's show on 7/17 (Nine Days) I can include it on your  first weeks check, as Tuesday is our cut-off day!

Hi Bob,
Sorry I missed you today.  I have attached two pictures.  One picture is what we are kind of looking for.  The other is one of the locations.  This attached location is next to zacs bay by Jones Beach.  I am looking for a quote for two of these Array Towers. I am looking for the one tower to be out a few hundred feet away and to be wireless.  Included in the quote I would like a tech, mixer, at least two wireless mics and availability to hook up a iPad or laptop for music.  We can talk more tomorrow.  Thank you,

 Hi Bobby,

    You may have already gotten the date but I wanted to get it all into an email!

          This year's 9/11 Memorial is scheduled to be held Thursday, September 6, 2018 at 7PM at TOBAY Beach.   We would like to keep the same red, white and blue up lighting on the Memorial wall, tent lighting, podium spot lights, vocalist spot, pathway lighting for safety, lighting on the American Flag etc.   Pretty much the same as the past few years.    Thanks!

I am Pearce Farnum's fiancé. I just wanted to follow up on the pricing you
gave him, as it doesn't provide much detail. I am looking to do string
lighting across the dance floor. I know you suggested the up lighting in
the windows. Do you guys do any ala carte options? I really don't need all
the bells and whistles, I really just want up lighting and a spotlight. We
are trying to be budget friendly! Just wanted to inquire. Also, my sister
used you for her wedding back in 2014. Do you offer any ""returning
customer"" discounts or referral discounts?

If           you look closely at the picture above, you will note that all the           Marines pictured are bowing their heads.  That's because they're           praying.  This incident took place at a recent ceremony honoring           the birthday of the corps, and it has the ACLU up in arms.            
""These           are federal employees,"" says Lucius Traveler, a spokesman for the           ACLU, ""on 
federal           property and on federal time... 

          
          
          
 

          
          
          
For them to pray is clearly an           establishment of religion, and we must nip this in the bud           immediately.""             

          
          
          

 

          
          
          
          
When asked about the ACLU's           charges, 
Colonel           Jack Fessender, speaking for the Commandant of the Corps           said, 

""F*** the ACLU, GOD           Bless Our Warriors.  
Send           the ACLU to Afghanistan and then watch those SONS OF BITCHES           pray."" 

          
          
          
          

Please           send this to people you know so everyone will know how stupid the ACLU           is getting in trying to remove GOD from everything and every place in           America.

          
          
          

 

          
          
          
          
May God Bless           America,

I recall that Bob had to bring some kind of adaptor that he did not have the first year. He was limited with the lighting the first year, then he brought something (the same adaptor that Mitch uses for his lighting system)

Break Up the NFL’s Corrupt Dem Monopoly
Why it’s high time for the NFL to take a knee.
September 26, 2017 
Daniel Greenfield



Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.
An Army recruit starts off with a salary under $20,000. Thousands of active duty military personnel are on food stamps. Millions of veterans rely on them to feed their families and themselves.
That’s how we treat the best of us. Here’s how we treat the worst of us.
An NFL rookie’s minimum salary is $465,000. And the majority of NFL players are usually bankrupt a few years after retirement because they blew through most of their money. Dozensof NFL players are arrested every year on charges ranging from murder to rape to animal abuse.
2017 was a banner year for the NFL with three times as many arrests as last year.
Along with the usual drunk driving and disorderly conduct arrests, there were 7 arrests for assault/battery, 6 for drugs and 5 for domestic violence.
The Seattle Seahawks announced that they weren’t going to “participate in the national anthem” because of the “injustice that has plagued people of color in this country”. While they lost that game, they are one of the top ranked teams in arrests. Alongside the Los Angeles Rams, the Green Bay Packers and the New York Jets, all of whom showed some solidarity with the anti-American protests, these top NFL criminal teams have racked up arrests for domestic violence, drugs, DUI and assault and battery.
Is it any wonder they think the justice system is unfair? They’re criminals.
Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall was one of the early players to reject the Anthem. The Broncos supported his actions. As his teams have supported him during nine domestic violence accusations.  
Did any of the women he stabbed, punched or choked have any choice about taking a knee?
It’s no wonder that so many of the NFL’s millionaire scumbags are eager to join Colin Kaepernick’s protests against the justice system by degrading our anthem.
It’s because they’re criminals.  
And it’s no wonder that the NFL stands behind its thugs. If a team can shrug at a 6’4 man beating a woman, what’s a little anti-American tantrum by a prize property that makes them millions of dollars?
The only question is why are the rest of us subsidizing it?
NFL teams loot millions from taxpayers to fund their stadiums. The Seahawks have a point about injustice. Andthe injustice is that taxpayers had to spend $390 million on their stadium.
Who will let Washington taxpayers take a knee and opt out of being exploited by the Seahawks?
Ten New Orleans Saints players sat out the anthem. New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton expressed pride in the players who rejected the United States of America. The Saints not only enjoy a stadium paid for by a billion in taxpayer money in a city with one of the highest poverty rates in the country, but are exemptfrom sales tax. And receive millions every year in “inducement payments” to stay put.
Sweetheart deals like these are not uncommon. The NFL comes with a pass on property taxes (those are for little people) and taxes in general. Until 2015, the NFL was a non-profit. ""Professional football leagues"" was actually inserted into the Internal Revenue Code to provide a special non-profit status. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got paid $44 million in one year. That made him the highest paid non-profit exec in the country.
The entire NFL is an illegal trust. It’s a monopoly that was illegally legalized by Congress.
That monopoly allows the NFL and its teams to cash in on television licensing and team gear. After the NFL uses its illegal monopoly to rip off broadcasters, ESPN rips off cable subscribers.
ESPN pays the NFL almost $2 billion a year. Even if you don’t watch ESPN, you’re paying $9 a month for it because of yet another illegal monopoly. If you subscribe to cable or live in a major city, the odds are good that your pocket is being picked by the millionaire racists “taking a knee” against America.





But the monopolies are dying.
ESPN is bleeding subscribers. The NFL’s anti-American turn is alienating fans. And cable is collapsing.
The NFL is built on government taking money from people and giving it to the industry. Its leftward tilt isn’t an accident. It’s a calculated move. Who are the folks most likely to bail out an industry? They’re on the left. Not the right. If your monopoly is dying, it’s time to go left and hate America.
Anthem bashing is popular with the left. And it’s very popular with the social justice bloggers who increasingly dominate sports journalism, and not just on ESPN. Hating America will score points with the left. It’ll buy the NFL more protectionism from the media and the 2020 Democrats.
The only question is why do we need the NFL?
Once upon a time there was a football free market. Multiple leagues competed with each other. And the NFL was just one of many. The NFL-AFL merger created a monster monopoly that has worked to crush any independent league through its control over broadcasting and venues.
That's what happened with the United States Football League which won an anti-trust court case against the NFL, but was forced under anyway.
The man at the center of the fight against the NFL was New Jersey Generals owner Donald Trump.
The illegal monopoly that created the NFL was the work of Senator Russell Long, the son of radical criminal Dem kingpin Huey Long, who illegally took over his father’s Senate seat (previously held by his mother) and spent almost four decades in the Senate with no qualification except his last name.
The NFL got a monopoly in exchange for New Orleans getting a franchise.
Congressman Hale Boggs, the corrupt Louisiana Dem boss who went to war with the FBI, got it through in the House by appealing, “The Republicans are out to get me. I need this to save me.""
And Boggs held things up until he got assurances from the NFL commissioner that the franchise was in.
That’s the corrupt Democrat deal that created the NFL monopoly. Of course the NFL thinks the justice system is unfair. It was created by a crime and it’s full of criminals.
Before the anthem protests, the NFL was just one of the corrupt legacies of Democrat rule. It’s a reminder of the fact that social justice politics, whether it’s Obama’s “You Didn’t Build That” or Huey Long’s “Share Our Wealth”, is nothing more than organized thievery from the working class.
But the NFL is no longer just a corrupt monopoly. Instead it’s becoming a radical anti-American organization that uses its taxpayer-subsidized stadiums and monopoly broadcasting rights to spread hatred toward this country and disrespect to the soldiers who fought and died for it.
America could have tolerated the NFL’s corrupt thievery. But there’s no way Americans should be subsidizing this diseased leftover of Democrat corruption when it spews hate at the United States.
It’s time for the NFL’s anti-trust exemption to go the way of Ma Bell.
Break up the corrupt Democrat monopoly of the NFL and demolish the barriers to the formation of independent leagues by taking on the NFL, ESPN and its broadcasting partners in crime.
It’s time for the NFL to take a knee and for the free market to rise.
Football must become an American sport again.

850,1830,Sara Guando,RE: FREE's 2018 Celebration of Life Gala,"Good afternoon MaryEllen and Bob,

I just wanted to follow up from our conversation last week. I have a walkthrough with Bob at The Mansion at Oyster Bay set up for Sept 10th at 10:30 am.

I was hoping you could send me some pricing prior to then. Some of the services we discussed were:

·         stage and microphone

·         teleprompting

·         large screen TVs to play video and event journal (at least 2)

·         iPads on all of the tables to also display the event journal (we typically have 25-30 tables and would need at least 2 iPads per table)

Please let me know if any of these services are unavailable so I can continue to reach out to other vendors. And if you can send me over some pricing that would be very helpful.

Great News!

The Coach John Boyle Memorial is well on its way..

Congratulations to our leader Tony Caiazza # 63 for his non-stop efforts to
get this worthwhile effort of the ground in record time... As many of you
know he is very detailed and passionate as Coach was his best friend. This
is really now becoming an alumni event from all classmates & athletes from
WTC.

So far, we have a great response to get this completed on such a short
timeframe.
We have pledges of 3k and others waiting to make their checks out - It is
such a wonderful opportunity to be able to part of this WTC community
effort.
Thanks in advance for coming on board.

Some updates & Highlights:

We have approval from the school board for the bronze Ram

We have a lawyer & former WTC Ram football player agreed to fund & is in
process of setting up a separate corporation for this effort. We will be
ready to accept checks & how to make it payable & hopefully by this coming
Tuesday.

At our meeting- We will have an agenda & discuss some of the plans for the
last home game of the season Saturday, October 27th.

Also joining our committee Coach Bob Gorman and Coach Ralph Capozzi - look
forward to seeing you.

The meeting will be 1 PM at the Harvest Diner on Old Country Rd. Westbury

We will share the good news & details and have an agenda for next steps and
how you can assist.

Thank you again - Go Rams!

“Build it and they will come”

Dennis “77”

I always forget, is the Heritage room the big ball room?  We will have 450 people in there during the evening.

Hi there –

It will be at Bethpage in the main big room.  Yes, video, sound and maybe a few additional TV screens would be great.  We are going to be showing a bit more information on the TV screens this year.

889,1348,David Goldberg,Re: ACDS event at Heritage,"Great, I figured as much. So it will be similar to last year but I need a little more. Mike and I will both be out of town on other assignments so I have my other team handling this. They’re well seasoned, but I don’t want them to worry about the lighting or displays. 

Date: 10/20
Event: ACDS Annual Fundraising Gala
Time: Cocktails 7, Ballroom doors 8 - 12
Location: Heritage Bethpage

Here’s what I need you to quote on:

2x 70” displays (or the largest that you own)
Box truss stands with black scrims
HD cabling up to video village - we will supply you with a single SDI feed. You’ll run out to your displays from there
Focused lighting on podium.
Last year we only had control over the par cans which was limiting. Can we use those and also have you aim/focus/color balance the moveable heads as well?
Tech to run lights for event
Last year we controlled lighting, but I would don’t want my director to worry about that this year

Last year you charged $500. I realize this will be more so let me know so I can run it by the client.

Thanks,
Dave

Package it up.

Create virtually unlimited packages that can be assigned to various event types. Each package can also run for a specific period of time. For example, if you create a New Years Eve party and only select the date range of dec 31 - dec 31 then it will only show up when a prospect select that particular date. You can also build packages by year. Maybe your prices are higher next year so you create duplicate packages and change the date ranges.

929,1830,Sara Guando,RE: Gala,"Good afternoon,

Hoping this email finds you well. I reviewed the production proposal that was sent over and we had a few questions/possible edits to make.

1. We would like to ensure that the proposal sent over includes the live streaming to the TVs in the room, as well as a recording, of the program.

2. We would like to put a cityscape lighting on the back walls (opposite the TV walls) and were wondering if you had anything similar to these:

Or, if inserts were purchased, you could facilitate this?

3. We talked about stage size and set up but we didn't talk about stage lighting and I was wondering what this proposal includes, if anything.

4. Lastly, we were planning on using the venue's sound system during cocktail hour but did want to know (since you are so familiar with the venue) if you felt additional sound or lighting support was needed on the rooftop.

Thank you for your help. I'm looking forward to getting this contract back to you as soon as we are able to clear up these questions.

We have an appt on Wednesday at 7 pm. As per our conversation earlier, I thought we are keeping that. I will call you on Sunday/Monday after we firm up with Temple at NS. 
But I would like to keep that appt if possible.  Thanks.

Barbara:  I realized when I was redoing the Invoice, that we now have to set up a “Finals” for next week sometime at Temple At North Shore.  If you want we can wait until you meet with them on Sunday, this way you have a better idea of  everything. If not  let me know what nights you are available next week.

Barbara  I should have changed the wording a bit, Yes it does include the Video Screen Package .  I will resend you a correction.  Also the 7:00 on Wednesday was originally at CATP.
I happen to have a Tech up at TANS that evening so 7:00 will work out.
